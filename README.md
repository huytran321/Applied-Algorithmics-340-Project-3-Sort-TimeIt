# Applied-Algorithmics-340-Project-3-Sort-TimeIt

This the third project in 340

Bigo module contains four find functions

This code uses the data size of 100, 500, and 1000.

To implement the rest of the points I would change the range size because implementing each iteration would take to a lot of time to load in the results since I repeated the timit 3 times to find the best time.
